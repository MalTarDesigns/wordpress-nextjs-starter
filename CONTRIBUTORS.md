## Original Foundation

This project is built upon the foundational work of the **Vercel Next.js team** and their WordPress CMS example:

- **Original Repository**: [vercel/next.js/examples/cms-wordpress](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/cms-wordpress)
- **License**: MIT License
- **Copyright**: Vercel, Inc.

The original example provided the basic WordPress GraphQL integration and Next.js structure that served as the starting point for this enhanced template.
